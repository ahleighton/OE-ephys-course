Project
#############
The final exercise is to work on your own project. This can really be about anything
you find interesting. Possibilities are:

- Hardware: expand on the EMG by adding filters or LEDs
- Software: use Bonsai to make a closed-loop experiment
- Simulator: build your own simulated circuit with different types of electrodes
- Theory: dig deeper into the topic that most appealed to you

When deciding on your project, try to break it down into steps. The best projects are designed to be
successful even if they are not complete.
