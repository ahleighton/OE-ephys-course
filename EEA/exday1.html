<div><ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Make sure the multimeter has batteries installed and is set to ‘Ω’. Put the red lead in the port marked ‘VmAuA’ and the black one in the port marked COM.</p></li>

</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In your kit you will find a Teensy 3.2. This is a small microcontroller that we can control in software, and use to generate output or collect input voltage signals. We’re going to attach it to our solderless breadboard.
If you need to, refer back to the reading material for the overview on how to use a breadboard, it also includes some basic troubleshooting which may prove useful if you run into problems. The most important thing is to remember which holes are connected. Your long breadboard is actually made up of two separate breadboards; + and – rails run through rows 0-30 and 31-60.
If you want to use the entire length of the breadboard, you will have to connect these rails together with wires.</p>
<img alt="../_images/eea_fig-10.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-10.png" />
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="4">
<li><p>Attach the teensy to the left of your breadboard as shown above. If you make sure the breadboard is in the same orientation as this schematic, it will make the following exercises easier to follow. Removing and replacing the teensy can sometimes bend the pins, so we’re going to leave it here for the whole course.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the USB to micro-USB cable in your kit to connect the Teensy to your computer. The Teensy comes with a default programme already loaded onto the board, so you should see the LED on the board start to blink slowly as soon as it is powered on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The kit includes a Teensy pinout card:</p>
<img alt="../_images/eea_fig-11.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-11.png" />
<p>Each gold circle (‘via’) on this pinout represents an input or output of the Teensy. Your teensy already has pins attached, so that you can use it in your breadboard later. This diagram (‘pinout’) shows us what each pin of the Teensy can do. It’s important to distinguish between:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ground pins (GND)</p></li>
<li><p>Analog pins, that can read varying voltages, such as a wave.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital pins, that can read or write HIGH or LOW values.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="6">
<li><p>We can see that digital pin 13 has (LED) written beside it. Attach readout wires to the breadboard, and use your multimeter to find the voltage across the LED.</p></li>

<h2>3. Ohm’s Law<a class="headerlink" href="#ohms-law" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During this course, we’ll be using a circuit simulator to build our circuits online. This allows us to quickly test our ideas and understanding, and make predictions about what will happen when we build the circuit in real life.
Ohm’s law describes how potential (V), current (I) and resistance (R) are related:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V = IR\]</div>
<p>When looking at a whole circuit, we can use this to calculate how much current will flow. Here is a simple circuit with a battery and two resistors. Current flows from the positive terminal of the battery to ground, which is the negative terminal of the battery.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://tinyurl.com/y4r8nsnj"><img alt="../_images/eea_fig-16.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-16.png" /></a>
<p>1.      Click on the image to go to the simulator.
Right-click on the top wire in the circuit, and then select Edit to display the current through that wire. Double-click on either of the resistors to decrease their value and see how the
current in the circuit responds.</p>

<h2>4.      Resistors<a class="headerlink" href="#resistors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here’s another simulation demonstrating Ohm’s law. This time, the current moves from a 5 Volt voltage source (bright green) into ground (grey, earth), across one of two resistors.</p>

<h2>5.      Voltage Divider<a class="headerlink" href="#voltage-divider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="in-simulator">
<h3>In simulator<a class="headerlink" href="#in-simulator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When we measure how much voltage is provided by a voltage source (such as a battery, or the output from the Teensy), we always measure it relative to a point that we consider 0V. In a circuit powered by a battery, we consider the negative terminal to be at 0V. If there is a connection to earth, or ground, this is taken as 0V.</p>
<p>Voltage (potential energy) ‘drops’ over each resistor, as potential energy is converted to another form of energy (such as heat or light). In a circuit powered by a 9V battery, all 9V of potential energy from our battery source <em>must</em> drop over circuit components, so that we end up back at 0V.</p>
<p>The higher the value of the resistor, the higher the voltage drop over it, but the total voltage drop over the circuit must equal the provided voltage.</p>
<img alt="../_images/eea_fig-18.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-18.png" />
<p>That means that, in a circuit with multiple resistors in series, the ratio of their resistances determines how much voltage will drop over each. We can therefore split up (divide) the voltage from a source across resistors. If we measure the voltage in between these resistors as V<sub>out</sub>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[|Vout| = |Vin| \frac{R1}{R1+R2}\]</div>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Always check whether your capacitors are polarised or non-polarised. Polarised capacitors must be used in a specific orientation. Usually, ceramic (the yellow ones in your kit) capacitors are not polarised and you can use them in either direction, whereas tube-shaped electrolytic capacitors (the black and blue ones in your kit) <strong>are</strong> polarised. The negative pin is indicated by a ‘-’ marking, and the positive leg is often longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="capacitors-direct-current">
<h3>Capacitors, direct current<a class="headerlink" href="#capacitors-direct-current" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Capacitors are made of two conducting plates, separated by an insulating material that prevents the plates from touching. Charges cannot jump through the insulating layer. Instead, charges collect on one plate, forming an electric field that pushes away similar charges on the opposite plate. This movement of charge is what gives us current flow in the circuit, even though charges cannot flow directly through the capacitor.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Q = C * V\]</div>
<p>The amount of charge (Q) a capacitor can separate depends on is its capacitance (C, measured in farads) and the voltage (V) across the capacitor.</p>
<p>In a direct current circuit, current will flow while the capacitor charges, as charge is pushed or pulled on either plate. Current flow will stop once the capacitor is fully charged. This electric charge can be discharged (and, for instance, used to power something) by providing a path that connects the positive and negative charges of the capacitor.
In this simulation, you can charge and discharge a capacitor and see the current flow through the circuit.</p>

<div class="section" id="alternating-signal-ac">
<h3>Alternating signal (AC)<a class="headerlink" href="#alternating-signal-ac" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>So far, we have mostly used resistances and Ohm’s law to describe how the circuit resists direct current flow. This is applicable to direct current situations (such as batteries), but the action potentials and LFPs we measure from neurons can go in both directions- they are alternating currents. So, how do resistances and capacitors ‘resist’ alternate current flow?
Alternating currents have different frequencies. Action potentials cause very fast changes in current (and potential), whereas synaptic inputs and their sums are much slower. We have to make sure the frequencies we are interested in can travel through our recording circuit.
Here is a demo where an alternating signal increases and decreases in frequency. At the bottom of the page, you can see the wave visualised.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Press ‘Play Audio’ to hear how the sound is modulated as the frequency increases.</p></li>
</ol>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://tinyurl.com/yyrvugha"><img alt="../_images/eea_fig-24.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-24.png" /></a>
<p>When we were only dealing with resistors, changes in our circuit happened instantly. We have seen that introducing a capacitor into our circuit means that we have to take time into account, as it takes time for the capacitor to charge and discharge. Resistors are not sensitive to changes in frequency, but capacitors are.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://tinyurl.com/y3sbgfl6"><img alt="../_images/eea_fig-25.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-25.png" style="width: 567.2px; height: 341.6px;" /></a>
<p>Here are two circuits, both provided by an alternating voltage source with a different frequency. In the scope below, the voltage trace of the source and the capacitor are plotted.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Change the simulator oscilloscope to display the current in the circuit (for instance the current flowing through the stretch of wire).</p></li>
<li><p>Add a third circuit, powered by an alternating voltage source of 120 Hz. What happens as the frequency increases?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To describe restriction of direct current flow, we used resistance (R). To describe opposition to alternating current, we need to use the term Impedance (Z)and takes into account time-varying signals. We will discuss this in more detail tomorrow. For now, it is important to know that the impedance magnitude of a capacitor, also called reactance (X<sub>c</sub>), depends on:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Xc = \frac{1}{2 \pi fC}\]</div>
<p>Where f is the frequency with which the current alternates, and C is the capacitance. With increased frequency or capacitance, a capacitor will provide less restriction of current flow.</p>
<p>When you see a capacitor in a circuit, you know you need to think about the frequency of the signal. Steady direct current has no frequency, so X<sub>c</sub> is infinite: capacitors only pass alternating signals.</p>

<h3>Capacitive voltage divider<a class="headerlink" href="#capacitive-voltage-divider" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because capacitors impede current flow, we can use them to build voltage dividers, just like the resistor divider shown above. Here is an example:</p>

<h2>7. The equivalent circuit of the electrode<a class="headerlink" href="#the-equivalent-circuit-of-the-electrode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the theory handout, we discussed how we can represent an electrode as a circuit containing a resistance and a capacitance. We’ll now build this equivalent circuit in the simulator. We will use this to examine the relationship between V<sub>ec</sub> and V<sub>in</sub>, i.e., how faithfully the electrode transfers the signal from our neuron to our recording system.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Use the simulator to build the equivalent circuit of the electrode as shown below:</p></li>
</ol>
<img alt="../_images/eea_fig-9.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/eea_fig-9.png" />
<p>Here are some values to use:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>R<sub>m</sub>: the DC resistance of the metal electrode wire, 10-100 Ohms.</p></li>
<li><p>Ce: the electrode tip capacitance, generated by the double layer generated around the electrode.  C<sub>e</sub> ~ 0.2 pF / µm2, so around 10 - 20 pF (if the electrode is unplated)</p></li>
<li><p>R<sub>e</sub>: electrode tip resistance, in parallel with C<sub>e</sub>. ~ 10 to 100 MOhm.</p></li>
<li><p>C<sub>s</sub> is the input shunt capacitance, due to the capacitance along the insulated portion of the electrode and wire (~50-100 pF).</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>We can’t see much without an input signal. Add a 1KHz alternating voltage supply to mimic the signal coming from your cell.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualise the 1KHz input in the scope.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a new scope with the signal as seen by the end of the electrode wire. This allows us to compare the signal at the extracellular fluid (V<sub>ec</sub>) with what we’re getting out of our electrode (V<sub>in</sub>). How are they different?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The DC resistance of the wire, R<sub>m</sub>, is very low, so the voltage drop over it is tiny. We can treat this as a short circuit.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="5">
<li><p>Stop the simulation and remove this resistance. You should see that this hardly influences the relationship between the input and output of your electrode. We can therefore simplify our equivalent circuit by leaving this resistance out.</p></li>
<li><p>R<sub>e</sub> and C<sub>e</sub> are in parallel, and because R<sub>e</sub> has such a high resistance, little current will actually travel over this resistor: C<sub>e</sub> will have a much bigger effect on the circuit. Simplify the circuit even further by deleting R<sub>e</sub>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’re left with our electrode and the long wire represented by two capacitors (C<sub>e</sub> and C<sub>s</sub>).
Above, we described a voltage divider made of two (or more) resistors. Capacitors in series can act as a voltage divider too, splitting the input voltage up according to the ratio of resistance (impedance in the case of capacitors) that they provide.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="7">
<li><p>What is the ratio between C<sub>e</sub> and C<sub>s</sub> at the moment? How much of our voltage V<sub>ec</sub> is reaching the output of our electrode, V<sub>in</sub>?  What could we change to get more of our voltage signal reaching the output? Try changing values in the simulator to get a larger amplitude output signal.</p></li>
