Software Requirements
***********************************

1. Download & install the software for the oscilloscope `here: <https://www.picotech.com/downloads>`_

    - You have a 2204A Scope.
    - Version 6.14.54 as of November 2021
    - Do NOT download the automotive version, it will make your oscilloscope look dead and freak your TA out.
    - Before starting the course, try connecting your oscilloscope and make sure it works (you don't need to provide any signal, just make sure you see a line appear in the software that varies if you move the scope around).

2. Download & install the Arduino Software `here <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>`_

3. Download & install TeensyDuino, `Available here <https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html>`_

    - This is an add-on for Arduino, install it afterwards and point it to where your Arduino is installed

4. Download Bonsai at `bonsai-rx.org <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/installation/>`_
